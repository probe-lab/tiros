## Measurement Methodology

We are running Tiros as a scheduled AWS ECS task in four different AWS regions. These regions are:

- `eu-central-1`
- `af-southeast-2`
- `us-east-2`
- `us-west-1`

Each ECS task consists of three containers:

1. `scheduler` (this repository)
2. `chrome` - via [`browserless/chrome`](https://github.com/browserless/chrome)
3. `ipfs` - an IPFS implementation like [ipfs/kubo](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/) or [ipfs/helia-http-gateway](https://github.com/ipfs/helia-http-gateway)

If run with `kubo` we'll run it with `LIBP2P_RCMGR=0` which disables the [libp2p Network Resource Manager](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-resource-manager#readme).

The `scheduler` gets configured with a list of websites that will then be probed. A typical website config looks like this `ipfs.io,docs.libp2p.io,ipld.io`.
The scheduler probes each website via the IPFS implementation by requesting `http://localhost:8080/ipns/<website>` and via HTTP by requesting`https://<website>`.
Port `8080` is the default `kubo` HTTP-Gateway port. The `scheduler` uses [`go-rod`](https://github.com/go-rod/rod) to communicate with the `browserless/chrome` instance.
The following excerpt is a gist of what's happening when requesting a website:

```go
browser := rod.New().Context(ctx).ControlURL("ws://localhost:3000")) // default CDP chrome port

browser.Connect()
defer browser.Close()

var metricsStr string
rod.Try(func() {
    browser = browser.Context(c.Context).MustIncognito() // first defense to prevent hitting the cache
    browser.MustSetCookies()                             // second defense to prevent hitting the cache (empty args clears cookies)
    
    page := browser.MustPage() // Get a handle of a new page in our incognito browser
    
    page.MustEvalOnNewDocument(jsOnNewDocument) // third defense to prevent hitting the cache - clears the cache by running `localStorage.clear()`
    
    // disable caching in general
    proto.NetworkSetCacheDisabled{CacheDisabled: true}.Call(page) // fourth defense to prevent hitting the cache


    // finally navigate to url and fail out of rod.Try by panicking
    page.Timeout(websiteRequestTimeout).Navigate(url)
    page.Timeout(websiteRequestTimeout).WaitLoad()
    page.Timeout(websiteRequestTimeout).WaitIdle(time.Minute)

    page.MustEval(wrapInFn(jsTTIPolyfill)) // add TTI polyfill
    page.MustEval(wrapInFn(jsWebVitalsIIFE)) // add web-vitals

    // finally actually measure the stuff
    metricsStr = page.MustEval(jsMeasurement).Str()
    
    page.MustClose()
})
// parse metricsStr
```

`jsOnNewDocument` contains javascript that gets executed on a new page before anything happens. We're subscribing to performance events which is necessary for TTI polyfill and we're clearing the local storage. This is the code ([link to source](https://github.com/probe-lab/tiros/blob/main/js/onNewDocument.js)):

```javascript
// From https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/tti-polyfill#usage
!function(){if('PerformanceLongTaskTiming' in window){var g=window.__tti={e:[]};
    g.o=new PerformanceObserver(function(l){g.e=g.e.concat(l.getEntries())});
    g.o.observe({entryTypes:['longtask']})}}();

localStorage.clear();
```

Then, after the website has loaded we are adding a [TTI polyfill](https://github.com/probe-lab/tiros/blob/main/js/tti-polyfill.js) and [web-vitals](https://github.com/probe-lab/tiros/blob/main/js/web-vitals.iife.js) to the page.

We got the tti-polyfill from [GoogleChromeLabs/tti-polyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/tti-polyfill/blob/master/tti-polyfill.js) (archived in favor of the [First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/) metric).
We got the web-vitals javascript from [GoogleChrome/web-vitals](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals) by building it ourselves with `npm run build` and then copying the `web-vitals.iife.js` (`iife` = immediately invoked function execution)

Then we execute the following javascript on that page ([link to source](https://github.com/probe-lab/tiros/blob/main/js/measurement.js)):

```javascript
async () => {

    const onTTI = async (callback) => {
        const tti = await window.ttiPolyfill.getFirstConsistentlyInteractive({})

        // https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/interactive/#how-lighthouse-determines-your-tti-score
        let rating = "good";
        if (tti > 7300) {
            rating = "poor";
        } else if (tti > 3800) {
            rating = "needs-improvement";
        }

        callback({
            name: "TTI",
            value: tti,
            rating: rating,
            delta: tti,
            entries: [],
        });
    };

    const {onCLS, onFCP, onLCP, onTTFB} = window.webVitals;

    const wrapMetric = (metricFn) =>
        new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            const timeout = setTimeout(() => resolve(null), 10000);
            metricFn(
                (metric) => {
                    clearTimeout(timeout);
                    resolve(metric);
                },
                {reportAllChanges: true}
            );
        });

    const data = await Promise.all([
        wrapMetric(onCLS),
        wrapMetric(onFCP),
        wrapMetric(onLCP),
        wrapMetric(onTTFB),
        wrapMetric(onTTI),
    ]);

    return JSON.stringify(data);
}
```

This function will return a JSON array of the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "CLS",
    "value": 1.3750143983783765e-05,
    "rating": "good",
    ...
  },
  {
    "name": "FCP",
    "value": 872,
    "rating": "good",
    ...
  },
  {
    "name": "LCP",
    "value": 872,
    "rating": "good",
    ...
  },
  {
    "name": "TTFB",
    "value": 717,
    "rating": "good",
    ...
  },
  {
    "name": "TTI",
    "value": 999,
    "rating": "good",
    ...
  }
]
```

If the website request went through the IPFS gateway we're running one round of garbage collection by calling the [`/api/v0/repo/gc` endpoint](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/rpc/#api-v0-repo-gc). With this, we make sure that the next request to that website won't come from the local kubo node cache.

To also measure a "warmed up" kubo node, we also configured a "settle time". This is just the time to wait before the first website requests are made. After the scheduler has looped through all websites we configured another settle time of 10min before all websites are requested again. Each run in between settles also has a "times" counter which is set to `5` right now in our deployment. This means that we request a single website 5 times in between each settle times. The loop looks like this:

```go
for _, settle := range c.IntSlice("settle-times") {
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(settle) * time.Second)
    for i := 0; i < c.Int("times"); i++ {
        for _, mType := range []string{models.MeasurementTypeIPFS, models.MeasurementTypeHTTP} {
            for _, website := range websites {

                pr, _ := t.Probe(c, websiteURL(c, website, mType))
                
                t.Save(c, pr, website, mType, i)

                if mType == models.MeasurementTypeIPFS {
                    t.GarbageCollect(c.Context)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

So in total, each run measures `settle-times * times * len([http, ipfs]) * len(websites)` website requests. In our case it's `2 * 5 * 2 * 14 = 280` requests. This takes around `1h` because some websites time out and the second settle time is configured to be `10m`

## Measurement Metrics

I read up on how to measure website performance and came across this list:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/Perceived_performance

To quote the website:

> ## [Performance metrics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/Perceived_performance#performance_metrics)
> 
> There is no single metric or test that can be run on a site to evaluate how a user "feels". However, there are a number of metrics that can be "helpful indicators":
> 
> [First paint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_paint)
> The time to start of first paint operation. Note that this change may not be visible; it can be a simple background color update or something even less noticeable.
> 
> [First Contentful Paint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint) (FCP)
> The time until first significant rendering (e.g. of text, foreground or background image, canvas or SVG, etc.). Note that this content is not necessarily useful or meaningful.
> 
> [First Meaningful Paint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_meaningful_paint) (FMP)
> The time at which useful content is rendered to the screen.
> 
> [Largest Contentful Paint](https://wicg.github.io/largest-contentful-paint/) (LCP)
> The render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport.
> 
> [Speed index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Speed_index)
> Measures the average time for pixels on the visible screen to be painted.
> 
> [Time to interactive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Time_to_interactive)
> Time until the UI is available for user interaction (i.e. the last [long task](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Long_task) of the load process finishes).

I think the relevant metrics on this list for us are `First Contentful Paint`, `Largest Contentful Paint`, and `Time to interactive`. `First Meaningful Paint` is deprecated (you can see that if you follow the link) and they recommend: "[...] consider using the [LargestContentfulPaint API](https://wicg.github.io/largest-contentful-paint/) instead.".

`First paint` would include changes that "may not be visible", so I'm not particularly fond of this metric.

`Speed index` seems to be very much website-specific. With that, I mean that the network wouldn't play a role in this metric. We would measure the performance of the website itself. I would argue  that this is not something we want.

Besides the above metrics, we should still measure `timeToFirstByte`. According to https://web.dev/ttfb/ the metric would be the time difference between `startTime` and `responseStart`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11836793/224770610-1a02a082-96e6-4198-8af6-4682d76f2d41.png)

In the above graph you can also see the two timestamps `domContentLoadedEventStart` and `domContentLoadedEventEnd`. So I would think that the `domContentLoaded` metric would just be the difference between the two. However, this seems to only account for the processing time of the HTML ([+ deferred JS scripts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event)).

We could instead define `domContentLoaded` as the time difference between `startTime` and `domContentLoadedEventEnd`.

```

## Development

To test the tool locally, you need to start a database, kubo node, and headless chrome. You can do all of this by running:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Then you need to point `tiros` to your local deployment. You can do this by
_sourcing_ the included [`.env.local`](./.env.local) file:

```shell
source .env.local
```

Finally, run `tiros` via:

```shell
go build -o tiros .
./tiros run

# OR

go run . run
```

After the run has finished, you can check the local database for the measurement data. Run:

```shell
docker exec -it tiros-db-1 psql -U tiros_test -d tiros_test
```

to connect to the local database. If prompted for a password enter `password` or
whatever is set in the [`.env.local`](./.env.local) file for the `TIROS_RUN_DATABASE_PASSWORD` environment variable.

Example output:

```
$ docker exec -it tiros-db-1 psql -U tiros_test -d tiros_test                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3s

### Migrations

To create a new migration run:

```shell
migrate create -ext sql -dir migrations -seq create_measurements_table
```

To create the database models

```shell
make models
```

## Alternative IPFS Implementation

An alternative IPFS implementation needs to support a couple of things:

1. The [`/api/v0/repo/gc`](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/rpc/#api-v0-repo-gc) endpoint
2. The [`/api/v0/version`](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/rpc/#api-v0-version) endpoint
3. Expose a [rudimentary IPFS Gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/) that at least supports resolving IPNS links
